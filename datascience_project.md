# Data Science Practical Project for practice

## 🎬 MOVIE REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYZER (IMDB Dataset)
**Why This Project?**
This single project will make you practice EVERY concept from your repository in the CORRECT sequence. You'll build the SAME system multiple times with increasing complexity and see your accuracy improve from ~60% to ~94%.
