Data Analysis and Visulization:
#### 1. Distribution
The distribution of data refers to how the values of a variable are spread out or arranged. In other words, it tells you how often each value or range of values occurs in your dataset.

**A distribution can be visualized in different ways**, such as:

**Histograms:** Show the frequency of data points within certain intervals (bins). <br>
**Boxplots:** Provide a summary of the distribution, showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. <br>
**Probability Distribution:** This is the theoretical model describing how the values of a variable are distributed, like normal distribution or exponential distribution. <br>
**Example:** If you have a dataset of people's ages, the distribution tells you how many people fall into certain age groups (e.g., 20-30 years old, 30-40 years old, etc.).
#### 2. Spread or Dispersion
The spread or dispersion of the data refers to the extent to which the values in your dataset differ from the average or central value. It answers the question: How much do the values vary?

**There are a few key measures of dispersion (spread):**

**a. Range**
The range is the simplest measure of spread, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. <br>
Formula: <br>
Range=Maximum¬†Value‚àíMinimum¬†Value <br>
Example: If your data points are ages of people: 18, 25, 30, 35, 60, then the range is 60‚àí18=42

**b. Variance**
Variance measures how far each data point is from the mean (average) and gives us an idea of how spread out the values are. The higher the variance, the more spread out the data is. <br>
Formula:

Variance=1/ùëõ‚àë(ùëãùëñ‚àíùúá)square <br>
where: <br>
ùëãùëñ‚Äã  <br>
  is each individual data point <br>
ùúá <br>
Œº is the mean of the data <br>
ùëõ <br>
n is the number of data points <br>
Example: If most data points are close to the mean, variance will be small; if data points are spread out, variance will be large.

**c. Standard Deviation**  <br>
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It‚Äôs more interpretable than variance because it‚Äôs in the same units as the data. <br>

Formula: <br>

Standard¬†Deviation= squre root of Variance‚Äã <br>
 
**Example:** If the standard deviation is small, the data points are close to the mean. If it's large, the data points are spread out across a wider range.

**d. Interquartile Range (IQR)**  <br>
IQR measures the range within which the central 50% of data points lie. It's calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). <br>

Formula:<br>
IQR=ùëÑ3‚àíùëÑ1<br>
Example: If the first quartile is 20 and the third quartile is 40, the IQR is <br>
40‚àí20=20. This tells you that the middle 50% of the data falls within a range of 20 units.

### Key Terms:
1. **Distribution**: Refers to how data points are spread out or arranged in a dataset.<br>
2. **Spread/Dispersion**: Indicates how much the data points differ from the central value, such as the mean.<br>
3. **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.<br>
4. **Variance**: A measure of how much each data point differs from the mean. It's calculated by averaging the squared differences from the mean.<br>
5. **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance, providing a measure of spread in the same units as the data.<br>
6. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The range between the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3), representing the middle 50% of the data.

### Visualizing Distribution and Spread:
- **Histograms**: These plots display the distribution of data across different intervals or bins, showing the frequency of data points within each bin.<br>
- **Boxplots**: These charts illustrate the spread of data by showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. They are useful for comparing distributions across different groups.<br>
- **Density Plots**: Similar to histograms but provide a smooth curve representing the distribution of the data, which can be more insightful for understanding the shape of the data.

### Examples of Distributions:
1. **Uniform Distribution**: All values occur with equal frequency. An example is rolling a fair die where each outcome (1 through 6) has an equal chance of appearing.<br>
2. **Normal Distribution**: Data follows a bell-shaped curve. Most data points cluster around the mean, with fewer points as you move away from the mean. This is often referred to as a "bell curve."<br>
3. **Skewed Distribution**: The data not symmetric. <br>
   - **Right-Skewed (Positive Skew)**: The tail of the distribution extends to the right, meaning there are a few very large values.<br>
   - **Left-Skewed (Negative Skew)**: The tail extends to the left, indicating a few very small values.<br>
#### Why are these Important?
**Distribution** helps us understand how our data behaves, and what patterns or trends might exist.<br>
**Spread/Dispersion** helps us gauge how variable the data is, and whether the data is tightly packed or widely spread.

#### What is the Analysis?   A detailed examination of anything complex in order to understand its nature or to determine its essential features

Data Analysis is the process of cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing the data to gain valuable insights to make more effective business decisions is known as Data Analysis.

#### 1.1-Working with Multi-index DataFrames
Multi-index allows you to select more than one row and column in your index.Mean we can combine/add/append multiple arrays,tuples,frames with different values as columns or rows to make one dataset.
We can use various methods of multi-index such as MultiIndex.from_arrays(), MultiIndex.from_tuples(), MultiIndex.from_product(), MultiIndex.from_frame, etc., which helps us to create multiple indexes from arrays, tuples, DataFrame,
## 2- Numpy Applications
#### Eigenvalues & Eigenvector
**Scalar:** 0-dimensional, just a single number.Example: 5, 3.14, -42<br>
**Vector:** 1-dimensional, an array of numbers. Example: [1, 2, 3], [0, 3.5, 6, 9]<br>
**Matrix:** 2-dimensional, an array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.Example: [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]] <br>
Here basically we have matrixlets say A=[1 2 3] and vector which is also a matrix X=[4 5 6 ],& when we compute them by performing the dot product ,at the end we have some value which is either 0 or some number that's what we can say our   
Compute the product AX
 for
AX=kX
  where  k
  is some scalar,When this equation holds for some  X
  and  k
 , we call the scalar  k
  an eigenvalue of  A
 . We often use the special symbol  Œª
  instead of  k
  when referring to eigenvalues. In Example  7.1.1
 , the values  10
  and  0
  are eigenvalues for the matrix  A
  and we can label these as  Œª1=10
  and  Œª2=0
 
When  AX=ŒªX
  for some  X‚â†0
 , we call such an  X
  an eigenvector of the matrix  A
 . The eigenvectors of  A
  are associated to an eigenvalue. Hence, if  Œª1
  is an eigenvalue of  A
  and  AX=Œª1X
 , we can label this eigenvector as  X1
 . Note again that in order to be an eigenvector,  X
  must be nonzero.
Let‚Äôs say you have a matrix 
ùê¥
A representing some transformation in space. If you multiply this matrix by a vector 
ùëã
X, it will generally rotate and scale 
ùëã
X. But if 
ùëã
X is an eigenvector of 
ùê¥
A, then multiplying 
ùê¥
A by 
ùëã
X will only scale 
ùëã
X by a factor 
ùúÜ
Œª, without changing its direction. In other words:

ùê¥
ùëã
=
ùúÜ
ùëã
AX=ŒªX
So, the eigenvalue 
ùúÜ
Œª represents how much the vector is stretched or compressed, and the eigenvector 
ùëã
X represents the direction that stays unchanged under the transformation by matrix 
ùê¥
This equation means that when we apply the matrix 
ùê¥
A to the vector 
ùëã
X, the vector 
ùëã
X only gets scaled by 
ùúÜ
Œª (but not rotated or changed direction). The eigenvector 
ùëã
X remains in the same direction after being transformed by 
ùê¥
A, but its length is scaled by the corresponding eigenvalue 
ùúÜ
Œª.

  ##### Why/Purpose of eigenvalues and vector
**1. Simplifying Matrix Operations:**
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors allow us to diagonalize a matrix (if possible), which simplifies matrix operations. When a matrix is diagonalized, it is represented as a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, making many matrix calculations, like exponentiation, much easier.

Example: In physics or in systems analysis, diagonalization helps reduce complex systems of linear equations to simpler forms.

**2. Data Reduction (PCA in Machine Learning):**
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a common technique in machine learning and data science for dimensionality reduction. PCA helps identify the "principal components" of the data, which are the directions (eigenvectors) that explain the most variance in the data. The eigenvalues tell you how much variance each principal component explains.

***Why it matters:*** In large datasets, many features (dimensions) might be redundant. PCA reduces the dimensions of the data while retaining most of the information, which makes the data easier to work with (e.g., faster training in machine learning).
## 3- Data Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
**Seaborn vs Matplotlib**
**Matplotlib** is a low-level plotting library that provides a high degree of control over individual elements. Even for basic functionalities, it requires more code.

Whereas **seaborn** is a high level library for visualization and requires less coding compared to matplotli.

**Matplotlib** lets users customize the appearances of plots, including color and styles.

**Seaborn** has in-built themes and color palettes making it easier for users to create visually appealing plots.

**Matplotlib** can work with pandas but users may need to manipulate data for certain type of plots.

**Seaborn** is very much flexible with pandas and it doesn‚Äôt require as much manipulation as matplotlib.

**Annotations** allow users to label data points and indicate trends or add descriptions to different parts of a plot.

**Both seaborn and matplotlib have style themes.**

There are **five themes** in seaborn:
`white,
dark,
whitegrid,
darkgrid,
ticks`
We will use style theme from matplotlib. Matplotlib gives 26 styles which you can be seen with the `plt.style.available` method.
**Output:**
`['Solarize_Light2',
 '_classic_test_patch',
 'bmh',
 'classic',
 'dark_background',

 ### What is Visualization?
Visualization refers to techniques used to communicate both abstract and concrete,behaviour,information, ideas by creating images, diagrams, or animations of objects
### 3.1- Data Visualization Explanation
Data visualization uses graphical representations like graphs, charts, and maps to simplify complex data, making it easier to understand and analyze. Visuals allow data scientists to summarize thousands of rows and columns of complex data and put it in an understandable and accessible format. It helps identify patterns, correlations, and outliers, providing a more effective analysis than tables or descriptive statistics. Data visualization is crucial in decision-making, enabling data analysts, scientists, and engineers to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders and inform actions, such as A/B testing or addressing bias in models like ChatGPT.

### Important Things to remember
**Data distribution:** describes the range of values in a dataset and how often each value occurs. It can be used to understand the data's center, spread, shape, and modality.
-***Data distribution can be represented graphically using histograms and box plots.***
-Two types of data distribution: discrete and continuous. Discrete data has specific values, while continuous data can have an infinite number of values.
**Data manipulation** is the process of changing or organizing data to make it more accessible, readable, and useful: 
**Purpose**
Data manipulation is a key step in data analysis and processing. It helps prepare data for analysis, reporting, visualization, and other computational tasks. 
**Techniques**
Data manipulation can involve a variety of operations, including filtering, sorting, aggregating, merging, and transforming data
### Missing data can be categorised into three types:
- **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR):** This means that the missing data
is not in any way related to any other data in the dataset.
- **Missing at Random (MAR):** This is when the missing data is somehow
related to other data in the dataset. 
- **Missing Not at Random (MNAR):** This occurs when there is a direct relation
to some missing data that the researchers haven‚Äôt measured.
**Standardization** is useful when you want to center your data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, especially when your algorithm assumes that the data is normally distributed (e.g., linear regression, PCA).
## Methods to remove the Missing Data:
- **distribution of data**: statistics using mean,max,etc
- **imputation of KNN**:
- **mputation with linear regression**
This imputation technique utilises variables from the observed data to replace the
missing values with predicted values from a regression model.

## FEATURE SCALING: NORMALISATION AND STANDARDISATION
Another common problem we encounter when trying to analyse data is having
different units of measurement for a particular variable.
### Methods for scaling
- **Normalization**
- **Standard Deviation**

#### Example of Standardization
#### Original Data:
[10,12,14,16,18]
**Mean (ùúá):** 10+12+14+16+1/5=14 <br>

**Standard Deviation (ùúé):** Let's assume œÉ=2.83 for simplicity.<br>
**Standardization:** <br>
Using the formula <br>
`ùëãstandardized=ùëã‚àíùúá/ùúé`<br>
For X=10:
ùëãstandardized=10‚àí14/2.83 =>‚àí1.41<br>
for X=12:
Xstandardized=12‚àí14/2.83=>‚àí2<br>
Similar for all others aply same formula 
#### Standardized Data:
[-1.41, -0.71, 0, 0.71, 1.41]

Now, the data has a **mean of 0** and a **standard deviation of 1**.

**Normalization** is useful when you need to scale data into a specific range (usually [0, 1]) and works well for distance-based algorithms and neural networks.<br>
Formula:
`Xnormalized= X‚àíXmin/Xmax‚àíXmin` <br>
‚ÄãWhere:
X is the original value,
ùëãmin
  is the minimum value in the dataset,
ùëãmax‚Äã
  is the maximum value in the dataset.

`When to Use:`
`When features have different units or scales` (e.g., height in cm vs. weight in kg).
`Commonly used when applying algorithms that rely on distance metrics`, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
`In neural networks where the activation functions` (like Sigmoid) expect values between 0 and 1. <br>
**But how do we know when**
`to use which one? Quite simply, you must standardise the data when it follows a Gaussian distribution. If not, normalise the data.`

Normalization and Standardization (Standard Deviation) are two common techniques used in data preprocessing to make datasets more comparable and improve machine learning model performance
## EDA (Explore Data Analysis)
When you're a beginner and find yourself stuck during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset, it's completely normal. EDA is a crucial step in data science that involves summarizing, visualizing, and interpreting the data to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights. Here are some steps and tips to guide you through the process:

1. **Understand the Dataset**:
   - **Read the Data**: Use tools like pandas in Python to load the dataset (`pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_excel()`, etc.).
   - **Check the Structure**: Use `df.info()` in pandas to get an overview of the data types, missing values, and the number of entries for each column.
   - **View the Data**: Use `df.head()` and `df.tail()` to see the first and last few rows of the dataset.

2. **Clean the Data**:
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Decide whether to fill them in, drop them, or use imputation techniques.
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Use `df.drop_duplicates()` to ensure you're working with unique data points.
   - **Correct Data Types**: Convert columns to the appropriate data types using `df['column'].astype()`.

3. **Summarize the Data**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Use `df.describe()` to get summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - **Categorical Data Summary**: Use `df['category_column'].value_counts()` to see the distribution of categorical variables.

4. **Visualize the Data**:
   - **Histograms**: Plot histograms for numerical columns to understand their distribution.
   - **Box Plots**: Use box plots to identify outliers and the spread of the data.
   - **Bar Charts/Pie Charts**: Visualize the frequency or proportion of categorical data.
   - **Scatter Plots**: Plot scatter plots to explore relationships between two numerical variables.

5. **Ask Questions and Formulate Hypotheses**:
   - Think about what questions you want to answer with the data.
   - Formulate hypotheses based on your initial observations and domain knowledge.

6. **Dig Deeper**:
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Use `df.corr()` to see how numerical variables are related to each other.
   - **Grouping and Aggregation**: Use `groupby()` and aggregation functions to summarize data by categories.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones if they might be useful for your analysis.

7. **Document Your Findings**:
   - Keep a notebook or document where you record your observations, hypotheses, and the steps you took during EDA.
   - This will help you stay organized and communicate your findings effectively.

8. **Iterate**:
   - EDA is often an iterative process. As you uncover new insights, you may need to go back and refine your approach or explore new angles.

9. **Seek Help**:
   - Don't hesitate to ask for help from more experienced colleagues, online forums, or tutorials.
   - The data science community is generally very helpful and supportive.

Remember, the goal of EDA is to gain a deep understanding of your data so that you can make informed decisions about how to proceed with your analysis or modeling. Take your time, be methodical, and don't be afraid to explore different approaches.
